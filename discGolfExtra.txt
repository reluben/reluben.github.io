Plastics: Premium blends like Star/Champion are grippy/durable; softer ones (DX/Pro/GStar) flip faster.
Beat-In: Tree hits/scuffs add dome/turn; e.g., Star mellows after 3–4 rounds.
Runs/Batches: Production varies (e.g., domey "pop-tops" glide more; flat rims flip easier). Popular: Calvin Halo (OS wind-fighter), Ricky Raptor (flippy), Sockibot (straight-to-fade).
Other: Lighter weights (155–165g) = more US; heavier (170g+) = OS.

GETTING MORE DISCS BUT STILL A BEGINNER
================================================================
Important note: Finding a disc that YOU throw well will help you play better, however, this doesn’t replace practice. Putting is the most important and least practiced shot.

Look for these traits:
- 9 speed or lower (some say 9 or lower). Do not worry about distance drivers yet
- Lots of glide (4 or higher)
- Understable or straight flight (turn -2 or -3)
- Less fade is generally easier for beginners (if you go to the Innova website(https://www.innovadiscs.com/disc-golf-discs/) you'll see easier to throw discs on the right. These always have low fade.)
- Lightweight; 165-170g is magic for new arms (some say 150g-170g)

Places to buy
If you're buying new choose a lighter weight in the plastic mentioned. You can also buy from Innova Factory Second website for a slight discount, no graphics (if that's what you prefer), and sometimes a bonus disc with your order. You can also buy some from Facebook Marketplace, disc golf stores (they do have used sections), or even at the first hole of a disc golf course (if there's a nice homeless guy selling there). Discs are usually less than $20 new and between $5-$10 used.
