Yes, there are several discs that mimic the Destroyer's magic for a "one-disc challenge" or minimalist bag—versatile distance drivers (speed 12-ish) that evolve through wear stages (new/beefy → beat-in straight → flippy worn) to cover hyzers, S-lines, straight bombs, anhyzers, rollers, and even approaches with power-down throws. The Destroyer (12/5/-1/3) is the gold standard because its flight covers ~4 molds' worth of stability, but these clones/alternatives are frequently recommended in pro bags, Reddit threads, and 2025 reviews for the same reason: bag 4–6 in graduated plastics/wear, and you're set for 80–90% of shots (though putts/approaches will still suffer without slower discs).
**Yes, you absolutely can play disc golf with *only* Destroyers—no putters or midranges required.** It's a popular "one disc challenge" or minimalist bag hack, especially for advanced players (950+ rated) with the power to tame a speed 12 (12/5/-1/3). Pros like those on Team Innova bag 4-8 Destroyers in varying wear/plastics for every line, so skipping slower discs entirely is viable.

### Why It Works (Especially for Good Players)
- **Versatility Across Wear Stages**: Destroyers evolve predictably:
  | Wear Stage | Flight (RHBH) | Best For |
  |------------|---------------|----------|
  | New/Beefy (Halo Star/Champion) | Straight w/ hard late fade (minimal turn) | Headwinds, hyzers, forehand bombs, skips |
  | Beat-In Star (field work 5-10 rounds) | Slight turn → glide → S-curve fade | Max distance (450-550+ ft), straight bombers |
  | Flippy DX/Pro (20+ rounds) | Big turn + glide (like a fairway) | Tailwinds, anhyzers, rollers |

- **Approaches & Upturns**: Thumber/flick low-power hyzers (150-250 ft) or rollers for control. Fan grip or reduced power tames speed.
- **Putting**: Spin-putt from <30 ft (aim low left for chains catch). Outside that? Approach close first—your scores will suffer (+5-10 strokes/round), but it's playable & fun.

Real-world proof: Players report personal bests on wooded/open courses with just Destroyers (e.g., 300-400 ft consistent, even in tournaments with minimal bags).

### "Destroyer-Only" Bag Setup (6-10 Discs)
1. **2-3 New OS** (Halo Star/Champion, 173-175g): Wind fighters, hyzers.
2. **3-4 Beat-In** (Star, 170-173g): Distance workhorses.
3. **1-2 Flippy** (DX/Pro, 165-170g): Utility/turnovers.
- **Total Cost**: $60-100 (Infinite Discs used bins for beat-ins).

### Caveats (Expect Tradeoffs)
| Shot Type | Destroyer Rating | Pro Tip |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Long Drives (>350 ft) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Beast mode—your Destroyers shine. |
| Approaches (100-250 ft) | ⭐⭐⭐ | Power down or thumber; less precise than mids. |
| Putting (<50 ft) | ⭐⭐ | Spin it hard; chains grab better than you'd think, but C1X putts = +1s. |
| Technical Woods | ⭐⭐ | Gaps/hyzers ok; tight lines punish speed (use rollers). |

You'll score worse overall (+8-15 strokes vs. full bag) due to less control on 70% of shots (approaches/putts). But for practice, fun challenges, or open courses? Epic. Builds form by forcing adaptation.

**TL;DR**: Do it—bag 6+ in graduated wear. Buy used Star/DX at Infinite Discs ($8-12 ea). Throw a "Destroyer-only" round this weekend & report back. You'll crush drives, grind approaches, & laugh at putts. If scores tank too hard, add a Zone later.

GETTING MORE DISCS BUT STILL A BEGINNER
================================================================
Important note: Finding a disc that YOU throw well will help you play better, however, this doesn’t replace practice. Putting is the most important and least practiced shot.

Look for these traits:
- 9 speed or lower (some say 9 or lower). Do not worry about distance drivers yet
- Lots of glide (4 or higher)
- Understable or straight flight (turn -2 or -3)
- Less fade is generally easier for beginners (if you go to the Innova website(https://www.innovadiscs.com/disc-golf-discs/) you'll see easier to throw discs on the right. These always have low fade.)
- Lightweight; 165-170g is magic for new arms (some say 150g-170g)

Places to buy
If you're buying new choose a lighter weight in the plastic mentioned. You can also buy from Innova Factory Second website for a slight discount, no graphics (if that's what you prefer), and sometimes a bonus disc with your order. You can also buy some from Facebook Marketplace, disc golf stores (they do have used sections), or even at the first hole of a disc golf course (if there's a nice homeless guy selling there). Discs are usually less than $20 new and between $5-$10 used.

Discmania P2 (D-line Flex 2)

Westside Maiden is one of the best beginner putters because its extremely straight-to-understable flight (3 | 4 | -1 | 1) flight in soft BT plastic flies perfectly straight or gently turns with almost no power, making putting and 150–250 ft approaches feel effortless and confidence-building from day one.

Discraft Comet (ESP or Z) – One-Sentence Beginner Summary
The Discraft Comet is a legendary beginner-to-intermediate midrange because its understable-yet-glidey flight (4 | 5 | -2 | 1) turns gently right (RHBH) and holds any line you give it with almost no power, making 200–300 ft straight or turnover shots stupidly easy and forgiving.
