        </table>
        <p>Putting is crucial because it often accounts for 30-50% of a player's total throws, directly impacting their score. Solid putting can save strokes and reduce pressure during the game, making it essential for consistent performance. <br>
            In the "<i>Fastest Way to Suck Less</i>" section of the <a href="beginner.html">Beginner article</a> the first piece of advice was to: &emsp;<i><b>Play 10 rounds (either 9 or 18 holes) with a putter only</b></i><br>
            This is for several reasons:</p>
        <table>
            <tr><td style="width:10%">Touch & tempo</td><td>Develops feel for distance on approach shots and putts.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Accuracy</td><td>Forces precise release angles and line control at all ranges. Slower speed discs are also easier to control.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Short-game confidence</td><td>Improves upshot-to-putt conversions from 0–200+ ft.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Shot creativity</td><td>Teaches low-power shaping (hyzers, anhyzers, turnovers) and safe layups.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Putting consistency</td><td>Repetition builds muscle memory for different holds and stances.</td></tr>

        <h2>Core Disc Golf Putting Techniques</h2>

        <p>
            Before you can start practicing some techniques you need to know what they are. Below are the main putting styles; there is also the the air-bounce to do underneath objects but it isn't very common. Try some of these putting styles and settle on the one that feels best. When you get better you can practice more styles.
        </p>
        <table>
            <th colspan=3>Putting Styles</th>
            <tr>
                <td style="width:10%">Spin Putting</td>
                <td style="width:50%">This style involves generating power primarily from a wrist snap and elbow extension, imparting high spin on the disc for stability. The motion is often quick and whip-like, with the disc released flat or with slight hyzer/anhyzer depending on the line.</td>
                <td>Longer putts (30-60+ feet), windy conditions (spin helps fight wind), or when you need a stable, penetrating flight path.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Push Putting</td>
                <td>A smoother, more linear motion where power comes from shifting body weight forward and pushing the arm straight toward the target, with minimal wrist snap. It produces lower spin but a soft, floating flight.</td>
                <td>Short to mid-range putts inside the circle (under 30 feet), calm conditions, or when you want forgiving misses that drop softly without rolling far.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Turbo Putting</td>
                <td>An overhead throw where the disc is gripped like a tray (fingers on rim, thumb below center of disc) and released with spin from forward pushing motion, creating a high lofting flight.</td>
                <td>Blocked by direct obstacles in front (e.g., bushes, trees, or fences blocking a normal line), elevated baskets, or heavy wind requiring a steep drop.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Jump Putting</td>
                <td>A dynamic style involving a leap or hop forward/upward during release, using leg drive for extra power. Release must occur before the jumping foot leaves the ground (PDGA rules apply strictly inside 10 meters).</td>
                <td>Long-distance putts outside Circle 1 (33+ feet, up to 70-80 feet), open holes where you need putter control over driver distance, or to clear ground play/rough.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Straddle Putting</td>
                <td>Performed from a wide, parallel-footed stance (feet shoulder-width or wider, facing the basket directly), often combined with push or light spin. It minimizes body sway and allows putting around leg obstructions.</td>
                <td>Obstructed putts (branches, bushes, or guardians near your feet), wooded courses with frequent low obstacles, or for players seeking maximum consistency with minimal side-to-side error.</td>

        <p><b><u><i style="font-size:24px"><center>PRACTICE</center></i></u></b><br>
            There's a little more to it, but practicing with purpose is the best way to improve.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><u>Develop a repeatable pre-putt routine</u><br> Example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Check the wind</li>
                    <li>Stick your disc out in front of you where you plan on releaseing it</li>
                    <li>Do one mock swing</li>
                    <li>Visualize the disc hitting the chains</li>
                </ul>
                Now you putt
            </li><br>
            <li><u>Fix your grip</u><br>
                Place your thumb on the top of the disc, closer to the outside of the rim; with your index and middle finger underneath you want to pinch the disc. The rest of the fingers should just be comfortable.<br>
                Other Grips include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Power Grip</li>
                    <li>Fan Grip</li>
                    <li>Two Finger Grip</li>
                    <li>Forehand Fan Grip</li>
                </ul>
                But in general, just start with a backhand grip and practice the others in the future.
            </li><br>
            <li><u>Find a putter mold that feels comfortable for you and stick to it.</u><br>
                Switching molds introduces a new variable that will prevent you from fixing your form and knowing how much power to put into a throw. I intentionally recommended many putters in previous guides to help show how a slight change makes a big difference.

            <tr><td>Routine</td>
                <td>Develop a consistent pre-putt ritual (e.g., deep breath, practice swing without disc, visualize make).</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Confidence Mindset</td>
                <td>Commit fully—aim to make, not "not miss."</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Balance & Follow-Through</td>
                <td>Stay stable (avoid falling forward inside 10m to prevent stance violations); follow through toward the target.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Start Close</td><td>Master 10-15 foot putts before focusing on longer distances. Confidence in short putts reduces stress on the course.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Stay Relaxed</td><td>Tension in your grip or body leads to erratic putts. Shake out your arms and keep your grip firm but not tight.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Learn from Pros</td><td>Watch professional disc golf footage (e.g., Paul McBeth, Ricky Wysocki) on YouTube to study their form and routines, mimic their techniques in practice.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Log Mistakes</td><td>Keep a notebook of common putting errors (e.g., “missed left at 20 feet, pulled arm”) and review it to target weaknesses.</td></tr>

            Attempt 10 putts from 25 feet. If you miss more than 2, restart.

            Place markers in 5 ft increments starting at 10 ft all the way to 35 ft from the basket.<br>
