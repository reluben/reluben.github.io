        <h1>Disc Golf for Beginners</h1>
        <p>Throw discs into <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket_(disc_golf)>baskets</a> in as few throws as possible. Free courses in parks. Just show up.</p>

        <h2>Rules You Need Day 1</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Farthest from basket throws next</li>
            <li>Play it where it lands</li>
            <li>Disc must finish in basket/chains</li>
            <li>Play behind where disc landed. You can mark it with a mini-disc, another disc, or leave it and throw a disc more suitable for the current throw</li>
            <li>Out-of-bounds = +1 stroke &amp; re-throw (or from last in-bounds)</li>
            <li>Don’t hit people</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Start with 3 Discs (150–170g)</h2>

        <p>R2 is MVP's recycled Neutron plastic but with added softness and grip. Since it's soft it beats-in fast, teaching how discs become more understable with use (harder plastics resist this more and take longer for their flights to change). This also means old discs don't need to be thrown out, they are still useful.<br>
            Different plastics affect how discs fly and feel to you. If you like these discs, you can try them in other plastics<br><br>
            Other companies make worthwhile starter sets; Avoid Innova, their quality and consistency have gone down. On the other hand, here are 2 good ones: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Discmania 3 Disc Premium (P2, MD3, FD)
            </li>
            <li>
                Discraft Mid Level 3-Pack (Jawbreaker Bangeer FT, Buzzz, Scorch)

        Definitions:
        <ul>
            <li><u>Beats-in</u> - gets dinged up and becomes more understable</li>
            <li><u>Understable</u> - refer to the flight-numbers page</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Fastest Way to Suck Less</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Play 10 rounds (either 9 or 18 holes) with a putter only</li>
            <li>Throw 100 discs in a field (flat &amp; nose-down)</li>
            <li>Putt from 7–10 m every round</li>
            <li>Film yourself</li>
