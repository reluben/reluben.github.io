        <h1>Disc Golf for Beginners</h1>
        <p>Throw discs into <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket_(disc_golf)>baskets</a> in as few throws as possible. Free courses in parks. Just show up.</p>

        <h2>Rules You Need Day 1</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Farthest from basket throws next</li>
            <li>Play it where it lands</li>
            <li>Disc must finish in basket/chains</li>
            <li>Play behind where disc landed. You can mark it with a mini-disc, another disc, or leave it and throw a disc more suitable for the current throw</li>
            <li>Out-of-bounds = +1 stroke &amp; re-throw (or from last in-bounds)</li>
            <li>Don’t hit people</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Starter Sets - Start with 3 Discs</h2>

        <p>A starter set is usually a good way to get into the game without thinking too much about what to buy (do not get the Innova starter set, their quality has gone down). Since putting is so important, I think the Kastaplast currently has the best set for a beginner to buy. </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th style="width:40%">
                    Kastaplast Kasta Set
                </th>

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Unlike most sets it comes with two putters, teaching you there is a difference between putting and approaching (the Berg has a thumb track which is a feature I prefer on putters; I use an Innova R-Pro Pig).<br>
            Another good set is the Dismania 3 Disc Premium Set. These discs are kind of considered legendary. The MVP starter set is also good but I believe a 9-speed disc is a little much for a beginner so it's last on the list.</p>

            R2 is MVP's recycled Neutron plastic but with added softness and grip. Since it's soft it beats-in fast, teaching how discs become more understable with use (harder plastics resist this more and take longer for their flights to change). This also means old discs don't need to be thrown out, they are still useful.<br>
            Different plastics affect how discs fly and feel to you. If you like these discs, you can try them in other plastics

        <h2>Fastest Way to Suck Less</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Play 10 rounds (either 9 or 18 holes) with a putter only</li>
            <li>Throw 100 discs in a field (flat &amp; nose-down)</li>
            <li>Putt from 7–10 m every round</li>
            <li>Film yourself</li>
