        <h2>PRELIMINARY NOTES</h2>
        <p>Right-Handed BackHand (RHBH) is the most common throw for beginners unless you are left-handed. Most discs tend to fade left at the end of a RHBH throw due to physics; if you throw a Right-Handed ForeHand (RHFH) it will fade right at the end. This is mirrored for a left-handed thrower.</p>

        <h2>FLIGHT NUMBERS EXPLAINED (Speed / Glide / Turn / Fade)</h2>
        <table>
            <th style="text-align:center">
                SPEED
            </th>

        <p>How fast the disc must be thrown for the other numbers to apply; correlated with rim width (wider rim → higher speed).</p>

                <td style="width:10%">Putters</td>
                <td>Very stable and accurate due to their slower speed and more controllable flight. Typically easier to make into the basket.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4 to 5</td>
                <td>Midranges</td>
                <td>Relatively straight flight path while still being able to fly farther than a putter.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6 to 9</td>
                <td>Fairway Drivers</td>

                <td>Distance Drivers</td>
                <td>Cut through headwinds best but need pro-level snap/power (400+ ft arm speed) or they'll dump early/turn too much.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Key Detail:</strong> Speed doesn't directly mean distance — a low-speed, high-glide disc can outfly a high-speed, low-glide disc for most players. Match discs to your arm speed and test with field throws (i.e. beginners should not throw distance drivers).</p>

                <td style="width:10%">Distance</td>
                <td>Floats far, maximizes distance for beginners/average arms. Risky in headwinds (stalls) or for over-powering (overshoots).</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Key Details:</strong> Glide shines at optimal speed - too slow, it fades early; too fast, it turns more. Lightweight discs glide more.</p>

                <th style="text-align:center">

        </table>
        <p>Indicates the disc's tendency to move in the direction of its spin during the fastest part of the flight (right after it leaves your hand). For a RHBH this would mean to turn right. This is the disc's High-Speed Stability (HSS).
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td style="width:6%">+1 to 0</td>
                <td style="width:6%">Overstable/Stable</td>
                <td>Resists turning right, flies straight, or fades left early.</td>

                <td>-1 to -5</td>
                <td>Understable</td>
                <td>Turns right during the high-speed phase of the flight.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Key Details:</strong> <br> Turn activates at/above rated speed; <br> Slower throws = less/no turn. If you throw a disc faster than its rated speed, it will exhibit more turn (it will turn over to the right more than the number suggests).<br> Wind amplifies: tailwind reduces, headwind increases. <br> Use negative turn for shaping shots around obstacles.
        </p>

                FADE

        </table>
        <p>Indicates the disc's tendency to move against the direction of its spin during the slowest part of the flight (towards the end of the throw). For a RHBH this would mean to turn left. This is the disc's Low-Speed Stability (LSS).
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td style="width:6%">0 to 2</td>
                <td style="width:10%">Stable/Overstable</td>
                <td>Finish straighter or with a gentle, soft landing. A disc with a Fade of 0 is designed to land as straight as possible.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3 to 5</td>
                <td style="width:10%">Overstable</td>
                <td>Provide a very predictable, strong finish, making them great for headwinds or shots requiring a sharp hook.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Key Details:</strong> <br> Fade starts later/harder with nose-down releases; earlier if underpowered. High fade = reliability for pros.<br> High fade discs are usually used for Spike and Skip shots.
        </p>

        </table>
        <p>
            A disc is said to be stable if it lands straight ahead of where it was thrown. Meaning, assuming we have a top-down (birdseye) view, for a RHBH the disc did not veer left (fade) nor right (turn) relative to the position it left the thrower's hand.
        </p>
        <table><tr><td style="text-align:center">
            <strong>Stability = Turn + Fade</strong> <br>

        <p>
            It might not be perfectly correct, but at the end of the day, you need to figure out how a disc flies for you. Many people say flight numbers are nonsense, even if they're wrong and they do matter, when playing it is important to find a disc that flies the way you want it to.
