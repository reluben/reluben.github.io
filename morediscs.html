        <h2>GETTING MORE DISCS BUT STILL A BEGINNER</h2>
        <p>Look for these traits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>7 speed or lower (some say 9 or lower)</li>
            <li>Lots of glide (4 or higher)</li>
            <li>Understable or straight flight (turn -2 or -3)</li>
            <li>Less fade is generally easier for beginners (if you go to the <a href="https://www.innovadiscs.com/disc-golf-discs/">Innova website</a> 
                you'll see easier to throw discs on the right. These always have low fade.)</li>
            <li>Lightweight; 165-170g is magic for new arms (some say 150g-170g)</li>
            <li>COMFORTABLE! The number one most important thing about a disc is that you enjoy throwing it and it feels comfortable in your hands. This is very much related to rim depth, plastic type, and disc weight. This is especially true of putters. Some discs have a bead (a bump around the bottom rim) many people like them, many hate them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Places to buy</h3>
        <p>

        <h2>One Disc Challenge</h2>
        <p>Typically, no one plays an entire round with a single disc. Many players agree that using a single mold driver is the way to go, a bag with 3+ 
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/w63ifm/comment/ihbgppk/">Destroyers</a> (referred to as a multi-loadout, run, stack, or lineup. 
            Will elaborate below). In actuality, a one disc bag is really several of a single mold in various plastics and/or stages of wear for a certain distance. 
            So it’s 3-4 molds in total: a few putters of one model, few midranges of one model, a few fairway drivers, and a few drivers of one model. 
            However, as mentioned here and in the beginner article, playing a round throwing only a single disc is a great way to improve. This is for several reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>By keeping one variable the same, namely the disc, you will learn how throwing diffferently affects its flight path</li>
            <li>It forces you to think creatively and plan ahead. Since the disc you will be using has certain flight characteristics you have 
                to figure out the best way to make it to the hole; you can't switch out a disc depending on the situation you're in</li>
            <li>You get to know the disc better. Some discs aren't designed to fly perfectly straight; Some discs are more understable in 
                different plastics, a DX Leopard3 flies differently than a Star Leopard3. By knowing how the disc performs you learn to throw the disc so it flies the way you want</li>
            <li>You get to know the disc better at different levels of wear. As a disc wears hitting trees, the ground, and the basket, its 
                flight characteristics change, its stability changes meaning if it was designed to have -2 turn it might perform now as a -4 turn or maybe a 0 turn. </li>
        </ol>
        <table>
            <th>WHY IT WORKS</th>
        </table>
        <p>Not all discs qualify to be part of a stack. The ones that do shine due to high manufacturing variability (domey vs. flat runs), predictable beat-in (gaining turn/glide), 
            diverse plastics/blends, and versatile flights that cover hyzers/anhyzer/S-lines/winds (90-100% of shots) when tuned across 4–10+ copies. <br> 
            Innova, Discraft, Gateway, and Westside all have several discs that come in many plastics. They start out differently from each other and beat-in 
            differently when playing in wooded areas (you hit trees) resulting in a single mold that covers all your needs. Different players prefer the feel of 
            different plastics and molds; stiffness, grippiness, rim depth, etc. all affect what you will prefer and pull out most often.</p>
        <table>
            <th>DESTROYER</th>
        </table>
        <p>The Innova <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/1k4k2rq/comment/moanbfq/">Destroyer</a> (12/5/-1/3) was released in 2007 as the world's first Speed-12 disc. It's renowned as the best-selling overstable distance driver in history, 
            favored by pros for its predictable flight, significant glide, and torque resistance. <br>
            It flies long and straight with a reliable late fade, excelling in headwinds, maximum distance shots, long hyzers, and sidearm/forehand throws.<br>
            The Destroyer stack is a popular disc golf strategy where players bag 3–6+ Innova Destroyers tuned to different stability levels, using only them for distance driver shots. 
            It is a TERRIBLE midrange and putter. Also, I believe a 12-speed is the fastest a disc could be before the small stability differences disappear as it beats-in. <br> 
            This (mono-mold approach) simplifies the bag, builds deep mastery of one versatile disc, and covers all distance shots (hyzers, anhyzers, S-lines, headwinds/tailwinds) 
            via subtle flight variations. It is the gold standard because its flight covers ~4 molds' worth of stability and it beats in predictably: fresh ones are overstable (OS), 
            while used ones gain turn/glide and become stable or understable (US)—allowing precise shot shaping without switching molds. </p>
        <p>Real-world proof: Players report personal bests on wooded/open courses with just Destroyers (e.g., 300-400 ft consistent, even in tournaments with minimal bags).</p>

        <p>This is the most heard of stack since the Destroyer is a truly great disc. Pros can throw it over 400ft. But we're not pros and we likely don't have the arm speed for it... yet ;-) <br>
            It suffers at putting while putting is the way to win rounds! So let's look at more realistic stacks. <br>
            This means they catch the rings better, are easier to throw, might not go as far, but still enjoyable and can actually be used as a single disc an entire round. 
            By this I mean no other molds AT ALL.</p>
        <!-- "Destroyer-Only" Bag Setup (6-10 Discs)
        1. **2-3 New OS** (Halo Star/Champion, 173-175g): Wind fighters, hyzers.
        2. **3-4 Beat-In** (Star, 170-173g): Distance workhorses.
        3. **1-2 Flippy** (DX/Pro, 165-170g): Utility/turnovers.
        - **Total Cost**: $60-100 (Infinite Discs used bins for beat-ins).

        ### Caveats (Expect Tradeoffs)
        | Shot Type | Destroyer Rating | Pro Tip |
        |-----------|------------------|---------|
        | Long Drives (>350 ft) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Beast mode—your Destroyers shine. |
        | Approaches (100-250 ft) | ⭐⭐⭐ | Power down or thumber; less precise than mids. |
        | Putting (<50 ft) | ⭐⭐ | Spin it hard; chains grab better than you'd think, but C1X putts = +1s. |
        | Technical Woods | ⭐⭐ | Gaps/hyzers ok; tight lines punish speed (use rollers). |

        You'll score worse overall (+8-15 strokes vs. full bag) due to less control on 70% of shots (approaches/putts). But for practice, fun challenges, or open courses? Epic. Builds form by forcing adaptation.

        **TL;DR**: Do it—bag 6+ in graduated wear. Buy used Star/DX at Infinite Discs ($8-12 ea). Throw a "Destroyer-only" round this weekend & report back. You'll crush drives, grind approaches, & laugh at putts. -->

                Note: <br> All the discs considered viable for one-disc mold only are
                <6 speed (the Cheetah is an exception).<br>
                    1. Putting is how you win, since faster discs have less surface area on their rims they do not work as putters (just like the Destroyer).<br> 
                    When you are get good, you can throw putters around 300ft and they grab chains much better than other types of discs.<br> 
                    2. People choose discs based on <u>hand-feel</u> and  <u>confidence</u>. 
                    If a disc doesn't feel good in your hands get a different one! It could be the mold, type of plastic, etc. Use 
                    discs you enjoy and play well with that help you improve. Doing well makes it more fun.<br>
                    Don't forget, finding a disc that YOU throw well will help you play better, however, this doesn’t replace practice. 
                    Putting is the most important and least practiced shot.</th>

        <tr><td>**Core Philosophy:** <br>
        Buy multiples in premium/baseline plastics, field-test on technical courses (tree hits add flex/glide without flip), and cycle worn ones. <br>
        Firmer = OS hyzers/wind; <br>
        softer = straight/touch; <br>
        beat-in shifts all toward stable/US. <br>
        ### Plastics Stability Guide (Consensus from DGCR/Reddit/Reviews) <br>
        | Stability | Key Plastics (Fresh → Beat-In) | Flights/Shots | Grip/Durability | <br>
        |-----------|--------------------------------|---------------|-----------------| <br>
        | **Overstable** | 4s, 3s, 2s, Diamond, Feldberg, PWP, SB-12/13/14 (firm flats), Firm | Hard hyzers, headwind putts, forehand skips, 200–250 ft drives | Stiff, durable; slow beat-in (stays OS longest) | <br>
        | **Stable** | SSS (Super Soft), Evo, Rec, Hemp Blend, Glow SSS, KC Pro-like Pure White | Point-and-shoot lasers, straight putts/approaches (150–220 ft), mild winds | Grippy/chalky; medium beat-in to straight flyer | <br>
        | **Understable** | SS (Super Soft), Eraser, Lunar, beat SSS/Organics | Touch flicks, tailwinds, gentle hyzer flips, spin putts | Floppy/grippy; fast beat-in (gains glide, minimal fade) | <br>
        ### Building Your Wizard Stack (Start with 8–12 Discs) <br>
        1. **Buy Fresh (5–7 premiums):** SSS/Evo/Rec (stable workhorses), 3s/2s (OS utility), SS/Eraser (US touch). ~$12–20 each. <br>
        2. **Beat-In Process:** Throw 50–100 shots/round on wooded layouts—tree hits add dome/flex (1–3 months: stable → US). Retire taco'd ones. <br>
        3. **Hunt Runs:** DGCR classifieds/eBay for "Hemp SSS," "Feldberg Diamond," or tour stamps (e.g., glow for night). <br>
        4. **Maintenance:** 20% fresh rotation; mark by plastic/fade (e.g., "OS Hyzer," "Straight Putt"). <br>
        **Total Cost:** $150–300 for a pro-level stack. <br>
        ### Shot Strategy by Distance <br>
        | Distance | Go-To Wizard | Release/Line | <br>
        |----------|--------------|-------------| <br>
        | **0–40 ft Putts** | SSS/Evo (stable) or beat SS | Flat/straight; hyzer for wind. | <br>
        | **50–150 ft Approaches** | Rec/SSS or 2s (firm) | Hyzer/flick; forehand skips. | <br>
        | **150–250 ft Upshots/Drives** | Feldberg/3s (OS) → beat SSS | Tunnel straight; flex anhyzer. | <br>
        | **250–300 ft Short Drives** | Firm/4s or Hemp | Power hyzer; tailwind straight. <br>
        | **Pro/Am Examples:** Reddit Wizard-only tournaments (soft provided); <br>
        collections with 4s–Eraser for full spectrum; <br>
        "Wizard gang" shoots par on technical courses. <br>
        **Tip:** Test grip in-store—chalky SSS for sweaty hands. Add mid/driver for open layouts.*<br>
