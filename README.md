# Useful Links — Homepage

A simple [homepage](https://reluben.github.io) that puts useful links all in one place and reduces the need for bookmarks.

## Links (in order)
1. Watching movies and TV shows
2. Watching anime
3. My (this) GitHub page
4. [Word Games](https://reluben.github.io/wordgames.html) — word games
5. [Alternatives](https://reluben.github.io/alternatives.html) — fallback links if primary links are down

# Extras (can be found in alternatives)
- [Timer](https://reluben.github.io/project_timer.html) — for tracking project time (useful for billable work) 
- [Disc Golf Articles](https://reluben.github.io/discgolf/directyory.html)

## Usage
- Clone the repo and open the main HTML file in your browser.
- Edit link targets and add or remove categories as needed.
