Useful links all in one place, with a simple interface. Can be used as a homepage in your browser which reduces the need for bookmarks.

The first link is for watching movies and TV shows.
The second link is for watching anime.
The third link is for using AI models.
The fourth is for a timer to track how much time you spend on a project each day (useful for jobs that require you to charge time to various projects)

Word Games
A page with word games that can typically be finished quickly.
From this page you can also go to word games that typically are not as quick.

Alternatives
A page with links the user can go to in the event that the links on the first page are down.

I also have a text file to help disc golf beginners; it is not going to be a link as I doubt it will be used frequently and I can't think of a way to implement it into the website that I like
