        <h1>SLEEP</h1>
        <p>Sleeping well is the number one most important thing for your health; After that comes getting plenty of sunlight, eating healthy, and minimizing stress.<br>
            The best sleep I've gotten in recent years was in December 2022.<br>
            I slept on a sheepskin on the floor, was phyiscally fit (had good lung capacity and strong muscles), and sleeping on the floor did not hurt my back (if your back is weak sleeping on a hard surface results in your lower back aching).<br>
            I slept so well that I woke up completely refreshed two hours earlier than I usually do for work! So I could either go to work very early or do something else. I decided to go to the gym. 
            At the gym I did everything I usually do and wasn't the least bit tired.</p>

                THAT'S HOW POWERFUL SLEEPING IS
            </th>
        </table>

        <p>I still had a lot of time before I needed to head to work so I did more excercises and (because I added weight too fast between sets of "good-mornings") hurt my lower back :(<br>

        <p>There are many aspects that affect sleep, all are health related. Besides setting up your bedroom for proper sleep, there are things you can do while awake to set yourself up for success (can't do much while sleeping). I will try to go in chornological order.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mewing and not mouth-breathing (see myofunctional therapy below). Proper tongue posture and swallowing actually helps you breathe better throughout the day and at night.</li>
            <li>Keep many plants in your house (and bedroom at night) to breathe fresh air

        <p>I believe weightlifting is stressful to the body. I also believe in reducing stress. Many people claim "working out isn't stressful" but a person's face at the gym says otherwise. Another claim is "yeah it can be stressful if you overdo it" this is stupid because where is the cutoff between overdoing it and not? No one can actually tell you, especially not someone who says that. There is a minimum fitness level for us to be healthy, having good stability prevents old people from falling and grip strength has been found to be a good indicator of risk of injury. Here are some excercises that I believe are beneficial when done in low-quanity with little to no added weight.</p>

        <h2>Myofunctional Therapy - Anti Mouth-Breathing</h2>
        <p>
            Myofunctional therapy (also known as orofacial myofunctional therapy or OMT) is a specialized form of treatment that involves targeted exercises to train and strengthen the muscles of the face, mouth, tongue, lips, and throat. It aims to correct improper muscle patterns and promote better function in areas like breathing, swallowing, chewing, speaking, and resting posture of the tongue.<br><br>

            Think of it as "physical therapy for your face and mouth." It addresses orofacial myofunctional disorders (OMDs), which are abnormal patterns where muscles don't work together properly, often leading to issues like mouth breathing, improper swallowing (e.g., tongue thrust), teeth misalignment, or sleep-related breathing problems.<br><br>

            The main objectives usually include achieving:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Proper tongue posture (resting against the roof of the mouth)</li>
            <li>Nasal breathing (instead of mouth breathing)</li>
            <li>Lip seal at rest</li>
            <li>Correct swallowing pattern (without tongue pushing against teeth)</li>
        </ul>
        <!--        Common Benefits and Uses
        Myofunctional therapy is used for a variety of conditions, including:

        Sleep-disordered breathing and mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — It can reduce the apnea-hypopnea index (a measure of sleep apnea severity) by around 50% in adults and more in children, improve snoring, daytime sleepiness, and oxygen levels during sleep.
        Mouth breathing and related issues
        Improper swallowing or tongue thrust
        Jaw pain or TMJ issues
        Speech difficulties (though evidence is mixed for direct speech sound disorder improvements)
        Support after tongue-tie release or orthodontic treatment
        Overall facial posture, bite alignment, and even some cosmetic improvements
        Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses shows positive effects, especially as an adjunct treatment for sleep apnea (e.g., reducing symptoms when combined with CPAP or other therapies). It's generally safe, non-invasive, and painless, with exercises being simple and repeatable at home.

        Typical Exercises
        Therapy is personalized, often guided by a certified myofunctional therapist (such as a speech-language pathologist, dentist, or specialized hygienist). Sessions involve demonstrating and practicing exercises, with daily home practice (often 5–30 minutes).

        Tongue push-ups — Press the tip of your tongue firmly against the roof of your mouth (just behind the front teeth) and hold for several seconds to build strength.
        Tongue slides — Slide your tongue back along the roof of your mouth while keeping the tip in contact.
        Tongue stretches — Stick your tongue out as far as possible or try to touch your chin/nose while looking up.
        Cheek pushes — Use your tongue to push against the inside of your cheeks.
        Swallowing practice — Focus on swallowing with the tongue pressed up, without cheek or lip movement.
        Consistency is key — many see improvements in weeks to months, with long-term retention of benefits.

        If you're dealing with symptoms like chronic snoring, mouth breathing, jaw discomfort, or sleep issues, it's worth consulting a qualified professional (e.g., via referrals from dentists, ENT specialists, or sleep doctors) for an evaluation. They can determine if it's right for you and tailor a program.

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p> Latex is made from the sap of the rubber tree. It is anti-microbial and doesn't smell weird the way plastic made of petroleum does. The sap is mixed with water to form latex which is whipped into a frothy foam. The two types of latex are talalay and dunlop. </p>

            Talalay pillows bounce back to their original shape very quickly (what I call rebound). This strong rebound makes my head feel like it's being shaken at night as if I'm on a water bed with my head being pushed side to side and I don't like it. This might be good for a pillow to support that supports your knees but for a pillow that supports the head I prefer wool pillows.
