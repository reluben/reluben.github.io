        <h1>SLEEP</h1>
        <p>Sleeping well is the number one most important thing for your health; After that comes getting plenty of sunlight, eating healthy, and minimizing stress.<br>
            The best sleep I've gotten in recent years was in December 2022.<br>
            I slept on a sheepskin on the floor, was phyiscally fit (had good lung capacity and strong muscles), and sleeping on the floor did not hurt my back (if your back is weak sleeping on a hard surface results in your lower back aching).<br>
            I slept so well that I woke up completely refreshed two hours earlier than I usually do for work! So I could either go to work very early or do something else. I decided to go to the gym. 
            At the gym I did everything I usually do and wasn't the least bit tired.</p>

                THAT'S HOW POWERFUL SLEEPING IS

        </table>

        <p>I still had a lot of time before I needed to head to work so I did more excercises and (because I added weight too fast between sets of "good-mornings") hurt my lower back :(<br>

        <h2>Improving Your Sleep</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Get sunlight first thing in the morning insha’allah </li>
            <li>At night use candle light and/or a red light filter on every light source</li>
            <li>Sleep in a room that is 18.3°C (65°F) and 45%-55% relative humidity</li>
            <li>Wear wool socks if your feet are cold (helps fall asleep faster)</li>
            <li>Keep a journal next to your bed for brain dump</li>
            <li>Have many plants in your house (and bedroom at night) to breathe fresh air</li>
            <li>Sleep naked for better temperature regulation, especially for men due to their scrotum</li>
        </ul>
        Some additional things that have helped me since hurting my back not mentioned above: 
        <ul>
            <li>Linen sheets</li>
            <li>Silk-filled comforter (never overheat)</li>
            <li>Firm latex mattress (I use a topper by SleepOnLatex, they claim it is an enhanced Dunlop)</li>
            <li>900+ fill-power down pillow</li>
            <li>Wool pillow (they have an adjustable fill)</li>
            <li>Silk pillowcase (this is the least effective one I believe)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you can see natural materials and a natural environment help a lot with sleep. Certain workouts can also help you sleep better. Here is a list I believe are beneficial:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Glute Bridges</li>
            <li>Squats</li>
            <li>Dips</li>
            <li>Pull-ups or just hanging from a pull-up bar</li>
            <li>Back extensions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p> There are two of latex types: talalay and dunlop. Latex is made from the sap of the rubber tree. It is anti-microbial and doesn't smell weird the way plastic made of petroleum does. The sap is mixed with water to form latex which is whipped into a frothy foam. </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td style="width:50%">Talalay</td> <td>Dunlop</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mold is partially filled with latex, vacuum-sealed to expand the latex, and then flash-frozen, washed, and dried.</td>
                <td>Mold is fully filled with latex, baked, washed, and dried.</td>
            <tr>
                <td>Softer, more consistent foam</td> <td>Denser and firmer</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bouncy and plush</td> <td>Springy</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>More breathable</td> <td>Less breathable</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            Talalay pillows bounce back to their original shape very quickly (what I call rebound). This string rebound makes my head feel like it's being shaken at night as if I'm on a water bed with my head being pushed side to side and I don't like it. I prefer wool pillows.
