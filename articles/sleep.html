        <h1>SLEEP</h1>
        <p>Sleeping well is the number one most important thing for your health; After that comes getting plenty of sunlight, eating healthy, and minimizing stress.<br>
            The best sleep I've gotten in recent years was in December 2022.<br>
            I slept on a sheepskin on the floor, was phyiscally fit (had good lung capacity and strong muscles), and sleeping on the floor did not hurt my back (if your back is weak sleeping on a hard surface results in your lower back aching).<br>
            I slept so well that I woke up completely refreshed two hours earlier than I usually do for work! So I could either go to work very early or do something else. I decided to go to the gym. 
            At the gym I did everything I usually do and wasn't the least bit tired.</p>
        <table>
            <th>
                THAT'S HOW POWERFUL SLEEPING IS
            </th>
        </table>

        <p>I still had a lot of time before I needed to head to work so I did more exercises and hurt my lower back :(<br>
            This happened because I added weight too fast between sets of "good-mornings."<br>
            In case you were not aware: 
            <center><i><b>BACK PAIN RUINS SLEEP</b></i></center>

        <p>Before we continue I want to mention a few things. You do not have to agree with, like, or follow what is written in this article. Ignore it at your own risk; I am providing a lot of valuable information not easily found or discussed all in one place. Much of what is written was tested on myself, and anecdotal evidence is real evidence unlike studies, most of which cannot be reproduced.</p>
        <h2><center>Stress</center></h2>
        <p>All stress is bad, affects you negatively and drains you. In middle-school (the curriculum is controlled by a certain family that does not have your best interest at heart) they taught us there's good stress, eustress, and bad stress, distress. This is 100% incorrect; here's the definition of eustress:
            <center><i>is the type of stress that comes from exciting events and positive challenges. It can be inspiring and help you develop resilience.</i></center>
            Resilience to what? This makes no sense because all stress causes nervousness, worrying and spikes your adrenaline. This leads us to our first point:
            <br><br><center>⏰<i><b>DO NOT USE AN ALARM</b></i>⏰</center>
            This is one of the easiest way to reduce stress and improve sleep for most people. Let's think about it: why would an animal suddenly wake up? So he can wash dishes? So he can watch a show on tv when it airs live? So he can catch a flight to Nicaragua? NO! <u>An animal would wake up suddenly ONLY for its survival and to avoid danger.</u> Animals sleep as long as they need to sleep, and ideally wake up when rested. Humans need sleep, the difference is they interrupt their sleep in order to live in modern society.<br>
            When I moved to Ohio for work in 11/11/22, I was working on a project that wasn't super urgent and was fairly complicated. Since it was MATLAB + Simulink more than one person couldn't really work on it at once, meaning I was effectively a team of one (although I did get a lot of help from others at the company). Since I was a one-man-wolf-pack my manager said I could come in whenever I wanted within a reasonable time (5am - 11am) and had to work 40 hours a week (I could do 10 hour days if I wished). 
            <center>😪<i><b>I chose to come in whenever</b></i>🥱</center><br>
            I decided if no one is waiting for me why wake myself up unnaturally? Plenty of people don't remember what they ate or did yesterday, how are you expected to remember or even know how much you exerted yourself really, and how much sleep you even need to recover from that day? Your body knows better than believe you do; <u>sleep when you're tired and wake up when you're rested.</u><br>
            Now, this isn't to say I never used an alarm. If I had come in late several days in a row and left at 6pm, I had to make up the hours to complete my 40 hours for the week; so somtimes towards the end of the week I did use an alarm, I do need made-up money so I can by real tangible food. Also, I'd like to think I'm not an ass; I had a coworker who shared the room with me, he wouldn't sleep enough since he worked on his D&D campaign until 3-4am most nights. He would then come into the office around 9am and sleep in the office. He realized if he showed up and did the bare minimum he wouldn't be fired and still make a decent salary; <i>infinite money glitch</i>.<br>
            Lack of sleep is no joke. It causes so many problems it's not even funny,

            but my biggest evidence that losing sleep is dangerous is the increase in heart attacks the morning of daylight savings time (DST).

            By the way, Arizona does not change their clocks, neither do countries close to the equator since they get the same amount of light year-round. Changing the clock never made sense to begin with but let's move on. I want to specifically bring your attention to the article <a href="https://medschool.duke.edu/news/daylight-saving-time-may-not-trigger-heart-attacks-after-all-study-finds">Daylight Saving Time May Not Trigger Heart Attacks After All, Study Finds</a>. As you can see from the title they are debunking my claim that losing an hour of sleep affects your health. I want you to really think about that for a second. If you are woken up an hour before your alarm by a police siren does that not bother you, annoy you, or ruin the start of your day? Someone said in a very good podcast:<br>
            <br><center><i>Do you know how I agree with a claim I hear or read? Because it makes sense to me.</i></center><br> So many studies result in answers that are counterintuitive and do you know what happens not even a year later? It turns out to be completely false. If something doesn't make sense it's probably bullshit.<br>
            So now let's go back to the article. They end the article with a section called "Sleep Still Matters" which I will include in the source code of this page right below this paragraph as a comment (it will not display right now). In it they write very important sentences:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>One hour of additional sleep, studies show, can reduce the risk of heart attack by as much as 20% in short sleepers.</li>
            <li>While the new findings may ease fears about heart attacks, other studies have linked the time change to increased risk of stroke, car accidents, and workplace injuries.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>  
These people do not give A FUCK about your health. I believe they ACTUALLY fucking hate you. They claim DST isn't an issue in their title only to proceed to DEBUNK THEIR OWN CLAIM by stating how beneficial it is to sleep just one more hour when you're tired. So people who use alarms to wake up are chronically tired, have crazy blood pressure spikes, have increased stress and anxiety, slower reaction times, and impared focus, but losing an hour of sleep once a year every year isn't a big deal. These people literally want you to fucking die as soon as you hit the age to start benefitting from your retirement and social-security. So the truth is losing an hour of sleep every year results in an increase in heart attacks the morning of the next business day (strange, people don't seem to set an alarm on weekends...) and gaining an hour of sleep results in a decrease of heart attacks that Sunday/Monday.
        </p>
        <!--
        Sleep Still Matters
        Still, the researchers caution that sleep remains a critical factor in heart health. Poor sleep and extremes in sleep duration — less than six or more than nine hours — have been consistently linked to increased cardiovascular risk. 

        One hour of additional sleep, studies show, can reduce the risk of heart attack by as much as 20% in short sleepers.  

        As work schedules have become more flexible and remote jobs more common since the COVID-19 pandemic, the one-hour shift caused by daylight saving time may no longer disrupt daily routines as much as it once did. 

        With fewer rigid work-hour boundaries and more digital connectivity, the time change may have less impact on sleep patterns and overall health.

        While the new findings may ease fears about heart attacks, other studies have linked the time change to increased risk of stroke, car accidents, and workplace injuries.-->
        <h2><center>Improving Your Sleep</center></h2>
        <p>There are many aspects that affect sleep, all are health related. Besides setting up your bedroom for proper sleep, there are things you can do while awake to set yourself up for success (can't do much while sleeping). I will try to go in chronological order.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>NOT mouth-breathing (see myofunctional therapy below). Proper tongue posture and swallowing actually helps you breathe better throughout the day and at night.</li>
            <li>Proper posture (helps you have more oxygen throughout the day)

            Minimizing stress is very important this includes physical stress not just mental and emotional. Many people claim "<i>working out isn't stressful</i>" but a person's face at the gym says otherwise. Another claim is "<i>yeah it can be stressful if you overdo it</i>" this is stupid because where is the cutoff between overdoing it and not? No one can actually tell you, especially not someone who says that. There is a minimum fitness level for us to be healthy, having good stability prevents old people from falling and grip strength has been found to be a good indicator of risk of injury.

            If you do end up working out, I would recommend you do not use machines that isolate certain muscles or muscle groups. It results in you not using your body's stabilizing muscles </p>

        <h2>Myofunctional Therapy - Anti Mouth-Breathing</h2>
        <p>
            Myofunctional therapy involves targeted exercises to train and strengthen the muscles of the face, mouth, tongue, lips, and throat. It aims to correct improper muscle patterns and promote better function in areas like breathing, swallowing, chewing, speaking, and resting posture of the tongue.<br>

            Think of it as "physical therapy for your face and mouth." It addresses abnormal patterns where muscles don't work together properly, often leading to issues like mouth breathing, improper swallowing (e.g., tongue thrust), teeth misalignment, or sleep-related breathing problems.<br><br>

            The main objectives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Proper tongue posture (resting against the roof of the mouth)</li>
            <li>Nasal breathing (instead of mouth breathing)</li>
            <li>Lip seal at rest</li>
            <li>Correct swallowing pattern (without tongue pushing against teeth)</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Mouth closed — Lips lightly sealed (no tension), teeth slightly apart or lightly touching (not clenched).</li>
            <li>Create a vacuum/suction — Press the whole tongue (especially the back and middle) up against the roof of your mouth and swallow. This squeezes out air between the tongue and palate, forming a gentle seal or "suction hold." It often feels like the tongue is lightly "stuck" or vacuumed upward.</li>
            <li>Tip of tongue position — The very front (tip) of the tongue should rest against the alveolar ridge — the bumpy/ridged area on the roof of the mouth, just behind (not directly on) your upper front two teeth. Many describe it as touching the "spot" right behind the teeth, or lightly contacting the back edge of the front teeth without pushing forward against them.</li>

        Used to Treat:

        Sleep-disordered breathing and mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — It can reduce the apnea-hypopnea index (a measure of sleep apnea severity) by around 50% in adults and more in children, improve snoring, daytime sleepiness, and oxygen levels during sleep.
        Mouth breathing and related issues
        Improper swallowing or tongue thrust
        Jaw pain or TMJ issues
        Speech difficulties (though evidence is mixed for direct speech sound disorder improvements)
        Support after tongue-tie release or orthodontic treatment
        Overall facial posture, bite alignment, and even some cosmetic improvements
        Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses shows positive effects, especially as an adjunct treatment for sleep apnea (e.g., reducing symptoms when combined with CPAP or other therapies). It's generally safe, non-invasive, and painless, with exercises being simple and repeatable at home.

        Typical Exercises
        Therapy is personalized, often guided by a certified myofunctional therapist (such as a speech-language pathologist, dentist, or specialized hygienist). Sessions involve demonstrating and practicing exercises, with daily home practice (often 5–30 minutes).

        ### How to Practice It (Common Technique)
        - Close your mouth and relax your face.
        - Place the tip of your tongue on that spot behind your front teeth.
        - Swallow normally (with lips closed and no cheek or lip movement) — the act of swallowing naturally helps press the tongue upward and create/maintain that suction.
        - After swallowing, try to keep the gentle vacuum/hold so the tongue stays up effortlessly (without constant effort).
        - A helpful cue: Say "nnn" or make a very light "k" sound to engage the back of the tongue, then swallow to lock in the suction.

        ### Why This Matters
        - In a correct swallow (called somatic or mature swallow), the tongue pushes up and back against the palate → no forward push against teeth → helps align teeth/jaw over time and supports nasal breathing.
        - The opposite (tongue thrust / reverse swallow) pushes the tongue forward against or between the teeth, which can contribute to open bites, crowded teeth, or facial changes over years.
        - The suction hold makes the posture "automatic" because the vacuum reduces the effort needed to keep the tongue up.
        -->
        <p>If you have a hard time mewing you might need to strengthen your tongue. Here are some exercises that might help:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tongue push-ups — Press the tip of your tongue firmly against the roof of your mouth (just behind the front teeth) and hold for several seconds to build strength.</li>
            <li>Tongue slides — Slide your tongue back along the roof of your mouth while keeping the tip in contact.</li>
            <li>Tongue stretches — Stick your tongue out as far as possible or try to touch your chin/nose while looking up.</li>
            <li>Cheek pushes — Use your tongue to push against the inside of your cheeks.</li>
            <li>Swallowing practice — Focus on swallowing with the tongue pressed up, without cheek or lip movement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consistency is key — many see improvements in weeks to months, with long-term retention of benefits.</p>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p> Latex is made from the sap of the rubber tree. It is anti-microbial and doesn't smell weird the way plastic made of petroleum does. The sap is mixed with water to form latex which is whipped into a frothy foam. The two types of latex are talalay and dunlop. </p>

        <p>
            Talalay pillows bounce back to their original shape very quickly (what I call rebound). This strong rebound makes my head feel like it's being shaken at night as if I'm on a water bed with my head being pushed side to side and I don't like it. This might be good for a pillow that supports your knees while back sleeping but for a pillow that supports the head I prefer wool pillows.
