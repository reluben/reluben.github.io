        <table>
            <th>The Most Important and Least Practiced Shot</th>
        </table>
        <p>Putting is crucial because it often accounts for 30-50% of a player's total throws, directly impacting their score. Solid putting can save strokes and reduce pressure during the game, making it essential for consistent performance. <br>
    In the "<i>Fastest Way to Suck Less</i>" section of the <a href="discgolf_beginner.html">Beginner article</a> the first piece of advice was to: &emsp;<i><b>Play 10 rounds (either 9 or 18 holes) with a putter only</b></i><br>
            This is for several reasons:</p>
            <table>

    <h2>Core Disc Golf Putting Techniques</h2>
    
    <p>
        Before you can start practicing some techniques you need to know what they are. Below are the main putting styles with the air bounce being the least common. Try some of these putting styles and settle on the one that feels best. When you get better you can practice more styles.
    </p>
    <table>
        <th colspan=3>Putting Styles</th>
        <tr>
        <td style="width:10%">Spin Putting</td>
        <td style="width:50%">This style involves generating power primarily from a wrist snap and elbow extension, imparting high spin on the disc for stability. The motion is often quick and whip-like, with the disc released flat or with slight hyzer/anhyzer depending on the line.</td>
        <td>Longer putts (30-60+ feet), windy conditions (spin helps fight wind), or when you need a stable, penetrating flight path.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Push Putting</td>
        <td>A smoother, more linear motion where power comes from shifting body weight forward and pushing the arm straight toward the target, with minimal wrist snap. It produces lower spin but a soft, floating flight.</td>
        <td>Short to mid-range putts inside the circle (under 30 feet), calm conditions, or when you want forgiving misses that drop softly without rolling far.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Turbo Putting</td>
        <td>An overhead throw where the disc is gripped like a tray (fingers on rim, thumb on top) and released with spin from an upward scooping or thumber-like motion, creating a high lofting flight.</td>
        <td>Low ceilings or direct obstacles in front (e.g., bushes, trees, or fences blocking a normal line), elevated baskets, or heavy wind requiring a steep drop.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Jump Putting</td>
        <td>A dynamic style involving a leap or hop forward/upward during release, using leg drive for extra power. Release must occur before the jumping foot leaves the ground (PDGA rules apply strictly inside 10 meters).</td>
        <td>Long-distance putts outside Circle 1 (33+ feet, up to 70-80 feet), open holes where you need putter control over driver distance, or to clear ground play/rough.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Straddle Putting</td>
        <td>Performed from a wide, parallel-footed stance (feet shoulder-width or wider, facing the basket directly), often combined with push or light spin. It minimizes body sway and allows putting around leg obstructions.</td>
        <td>Obstructed putts (branches, bushes, or guardians near your feet), wooded courses with frequent low obstacles, or for players seeking maximum consistency with minimal side-to-side error.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Air Bounce/Skip Putting</td>
        <td>Intentionally throwing low with hyzer angle so the disc hits the ground and bounces/skips upward into the chains, or using controlled loft for an "air bounce" drop.</td>
        <td>Low obstacles or guardians on the ground, uphill putts, or to curve around trees/terrain features; also useful in dry, hard conditions where skips are predictable.</td>
        </tr>

    <p>PRACTICE<br>
        There's a little more to it, but practicing with purpose is the best way to improve.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>**Develop a Consistent Routine**
   - Create a repeatable pre-putt routine: e.g., take a deep breath, visualize the disc hitting the chains, align your stance, and practice a few mock swings. Consistency in routine builds muscle memory and reduces mental errors under pressure.
   - Example Routine: Stand behind the disc, check wind, align feet, grip disc, focus on target, putt.
</li>
        <li>**Practice with Purpose**
   - **Short-Range Drills (10-20 feet)**:
     - Set up 10 discs at 10 feet from the basket and aim to make all 10. Repeat, moving back to 15 and 20 feet. Focus on form, not speed.
     - Goal: Build confidence in “gimme” putts to eliminate bogeys.
   - **Circle 1 Drills (33 feet)**:
     - Place markers at 25, 30, and 33 feet around the basket. Putt from each spot, aiming for 80%+ accuracy. Vary angles to simulate course conditions.
     - Goal: Master putts within “Circle 1” (the 33-foot radius around the basket).
   - **Pressure Drills**:
     - Simulate tournament pressure by setting a goal (e.g., make 8/10 putts from 25 feet). If you miss, start over. This builds mental toughness.
   - **Windy Conditions**:
     - Practice putting in different wind conditions. For tailwinds, use more spin and a flatter release; for headwinds, use a nose-up push putt to let the disc ride the wind.</li>
        <li>**Focus on Mental Game**
   - **Visualization**: Before each putt, picture the disc hitting the chains. This boosts confidence and focus.
   - **Stay Positive**: If you miss, analyze what went wrong (e.g., grip too tight, rushed release) without dwelling on the miss. Move on to the next putt.
   - **Breathing**: Take slow, deep breaths to calm nerves, especially in competitive settings.</li>
        <li>**Analyze and Adjust Form**
   - **Record Yourself**: Use a phone to record your putting motion (side and front angles). Check for issues like leaning too far forward, inconsistent release height, or arm pulling off-line.
   - **Common Fixes**:
     - **Disc Wobbles**: Likely caused by an uneven release or excessive wrist twist. Focus on a smoother, straighter arm motion.
     - **Missing Left/Right**: Adjust alignment or ensure your follow-through points at the basket.
     - **Short Putts**: Increase leg drive or release the disc with a slight nose-up angle for better carry.
</li>
        <li>**Choose the Right Disc**
   - Use a dedicated putter with a straight flight path and good glide (e.g., Discraft Luna, Innova Aviar, or Dynamic Discs Warden). Putters are designed for accuracy and chain-grabbing.
   - Avoid overstable discs for putting, as they fade too quickly. Stick with neutral or slightly understable putters for straight lines.
   - Tip: Mark your putters to distinguish them from approach discs, and use the same putter consistently to build familiarity.
</li>
        <li>**Adapt to Conditions**
   - **Wind**: In headwinds, use a spin putt with a stable disc; in tailwinds, push putt with a nose-up release. For crosswinds, aim slightly into the wind to compensate.
   - **Elevation**: For uphill putts, aim higher and use a softer release; for downhill, aim lower and putt with more spin to avoid overshooting.
   - **Obstacles**: Practice straddle putts (feet spread wide, facing the basket) for situations where trees or bushes block a standard stance.
</li>
        <li>**Build Confidence Through Repetition**
   - Commit to daily putting practice, even for 10-15 minutes. Set up a backyard basket or use a portable one at a park.
   - Track progress: Record your make percentage from different distances weekly to measure improvement.
   - Join local disc golf leagues or putting games (e.g., “horse” or putting tournaments) to test skills under pressure.
</li>

    <h3>Key Tips for Better Putting</h3>
<table>
    <th colspan=2>Key Tips for Rapid Improvement</th>
    <tr><td style="width:10%">Aim Small</td>
        <td>Pick a specific chain link (e.g., upper right for right-handers) instead of the whole basket.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Stay Focused</td>
        <td>Keep eyes on the target until the disc hits chains; avoid looking down early.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Smooth Acceleration</td>
        <td>Accelerate through release— no jerky stops.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Routine</td>
        <td>Develop a consistent pre-putt ritual (e.g., deep breath, practice swing without disc, visualize make).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Confidence Mindset</td>
        <td>Commit fully—aim to make, not "not miss."</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Balance & Follow-Through</td>
        <td>Stay stable (avoid falling forward inside 10m to prevent stance violations); follow through toward the target.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Start Close</td><td>Master 10-15 foot putts before focusing on longer distances. Confidence in short putts reduces stress on the course.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Stay Relaxed</td><td>Tension in your grip or body leads to erratic putts. Shake out your arms and keep your grip firm but not tight.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Learn from Pros</td><td>Watch professional disc golf footage (e.g., Paul McBeth, Ricky Wysocki) on platforms like YouTube to study their form and routines, then mimic their techniques in practice.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Log Mistakes</td><td>Keep a notebook of common putting errors (e.g., “missed left at 20 feet, pulled arm”) and review it to target weaknesses.</td></tr>

Sample Practice Plan (20 Minutes Daily)
    <ol>
        <li>Warm-Up (5 min)</li>
        Putt 10 discs from 10 feet, focusing on smooth form and hitting chains.
        <li>Circle 1 Drill (10 min)</li>
        Putt 5 discs from 20, 25, and 30 feet, rotating angles. Aim for 75% makes.
        <li>Pressure Drill (5 min)</li>
        Attempt 10 putts from 25 feet. If you miss more than 2, restart. Record results.
    </ol>
Stick to One Putter Mold
Don’t constantly switch molds or plastics. Find one putter that feels right and learn its release, fade, and glide.
