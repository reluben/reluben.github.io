WHAT THE HELL IS DISC GOLF?
================================================================
Disc golf is basically regular ball golf, but instead of hitting a tiny ball with a stick, you throw flying discs (frisbee-like things) into metal baskets. The goal: get your disc into the basket in as few throws as possible. Par works the same way as ball golf (par 3, par 4, etc.). Courses are usually 9 or 18 holes, free to play, set in public parks. No tee times, no greens fees, no dress code. Just show up and throw.

================================================================
PRELIMINARY NOTES
================================================================
The easiest way to find courses next to you is through udisc.com or the udisc app.
Right-Handed BackHand (RHBH) is the most common throw for beginners unless you are left-handed. Most discs tend to fade left at the end of a RHBH throw due to physics; if you throw a Right-Handed ForeHand (RHFH) it will fade right at the end. This is mirrored for a left-handed thrower.

================================================================
BASIC RULES (the ones you actually need to know Day 1)
================================================================
1. Tee off from the teepad in order (lowest score from previous hole goes first).
2. After everyone tees off, the person farthest from the basket throws next (called "away").
3. Play your disc where it lies (yes, even in trees, water, bushes).
4. Your disc must come to rest IN the basket or chained section to finish the hole.
5. Mark your lie: put a mini marker disc right in front of your thrown disc on the line toward the basket (or just leave the disc and stand behind it).
6. One-meter rule is DEAD (as of 2024) – if your disc is above the ground more than 1m in a tree, no penalty anymore, just play it or declare unplayable and take 1-throw penalty.
7. Out-of-bounds (OB): white stakes or painted lines. Usually re-tee with 1-throw penalty or play from last in-bounds with penalty.
8. Mandatory (mando): big arrow signs. Miss the wrong side = rethrow with penalty.
9. Foot faults on the tee: back foot can't be past the front of the teepad when you release.
10. Courtesy rule: don't throw if people are in range. Don't be a jerk.

================================================================
EQUIPMENT YOU ACTUALLY NEED (start here)
================================================================
You do NOT need 20 discs. In fact, the fastest way to get good is:

THE ONE-DISC CHALLENGE
Pick ONE midrange (see below) and play the entire course with it. No drivers, no putters, no excuses. You will learn:
- How to control angle
- How to throw flat, hyzer (ungripped edge pointing down), anhyzer (ungripped edge pointing up)
- Nose-angle control
- Distance control
- Creative lines

Most people get 10-20 strokes better in a month doing this.

================================================================
FLIGHT NUMBERS EXPLAINED (you'll see 4 numbers on every disc)
================================================================
Speed            | Glide       | Turn                   | Fade
(required power) | (hang time) | (right turn at start*) | (left hook at end*)
*RHBH
---

SPEED is the minimum spin each disc needs to achieve its designed flight characteristics. It is correlated to rim width (wider rim -> faster disc).

Low  (1-5): Putters (1-3), approaches/midranges (4-5). Easy to throw accurately, great for control/shorts shots, beginners. Fly well downwind but struggle into headwinds.
Mid  (6-9): Fairway drivers/control drivers. Balanced for accuracy and distance.
High (10-14+): Distance drivers. Cut through headwinds best but need pro-level snap/power (400+ ft arm speed) or they'll dump early/turn too much. Not for beginners - underpowered throws make them fade hard or roller.

Key Detail: Speed doesn't directly mean "distance" - a low-speed high-glide disc can outfly a high-speed low-glide one for average players. Always match to your arm speed (test via field throws).
---

GLIDE measures the disc's lift and ability to maintain altitude relative to its speed. Higher numbers mean more "float" for extra carry/distance, especially in tailwinds/no wind.

Low  (1-3): Drops quickly. Precise for approaches, wind resistance, full-power short shots. Less affected by gusts.
High (4-7): Floats far, maximizes distance for beginners/average arms. Risky in headwinds (stalls) or for over-powering (overshoots).

Key Detail: Glide shines at optimal speed - too slow, it fades early; too fast, it turns more. Lightweight discs glide more. Example: High-glide putter like Innova IT (6 Glide) helps newbies bomb approaches.
---

TURN describes the disc's tendency to bank/turn right (RHBH) during the initial high-speed phase, due to understability. It's like the disc "fighting" to flip over.

+1 (Overstable): Resists turn—flies straight/resists wind. Hard to flip.
0: Neutral—minimal early turn.
-1 to -2: Slight turn—hyzer flips to flat.
-3 to -5: Extreme turn—big right S-curve, rollers, easy flips. Great for tailwinds/distance but dumps in headwinds.

Key Detail: Turn activates at/above rated speed; slower throws = less/no turn. Wind amplifies: tailwind reduces, headwind increases. Use negative turn for shaping shots around obstacles. Example: Innova Mamba (-5 Turn) is a turnover machine/roller king.
---

FADE is the disc's inevitable left hook (RHBH) as it slows and loses energy, due to rim torque/gravity. Predictable finish.

0–1 (Straight/Understable): Minimal fade—holds line longest. Distance kings.
2–3: Moderate S-finish.
4–5 (Overstable): Hard left crash. Hyzer bombs, headwind control, skips.

Key Detail: Fade starts later/harder with nose-down releases; earlier if underpowered. High fade = reliability for pros. Example: Innova Firebird (4 Fade) hooks reliably in wind.
---

Example: 6 | 5 | -2 | 1  = Innova Leopard
Fast enough for distance, turns right a bit (helps new arms), gentle finish.

================================================================
BEGINNER-FRIENDLY DISCS (the good stuff)
================================================================

Look for these traits:
- Low speed (7 or lower - speed rating is the first number)
- Lots of glide (4 or higher)
- Understable or straight flight (turn -2 or -3)
- Less fade is generally easier for beginners
- Light weight (165-170g is magic for new arms)

Innova has two starter sets: the cheaper DX plastic set ($29), and the more expensive GStar starter set ($38); you cannot go wrong with either.

Do not worry about distance drivers yet. If you're buying new choose a lighter weight in the plastic mentioned. You can also buy from Innova Factory Second website for a slight discount, no graphics (if that's what you prefer), and sometimes a bonus disc with your order. You can also buy some from Facebook Marketplace, disc golf stores (they do have used sections), or even at the first hole of a disc golf course (if there's a nice homeless guy selling there). Discs are usually less than $20 new and between $5-$10 used.

Hall-of-fame beginner Innovas discs (pick one from each row):
- Leopard3 (DX or Star) | Leopard               | TeeBird
- Roc (DX or KC Pro)    | Shark (DX)            | Fox
- Aviar (DX)            | KC Aviar              | Dart

================================================================
HOW TO ACTUALLY GET BETTER (real talk)
================================================================
1. ONE DISC for a month (midrange or putter). Seriously.
2. Field work: go to empty field, throw 50-100 discs, focus on flat release.
3. Learn to throw nose-down (push palm down at release).
4. Film yourself (phone on tripod).
5. Putt 10 minutes every round from 5-10 meters. Putting wins rounds.
6. Learn the 3 angles: hyzer, flat, anhyzer. Everything is built on these.
7. Watch pros on YouTube: Simon Lizotte, Eagle McMahon, Paul McBeth, Kristin Tattar (women throw smoother than most men).
8. Play with better players, watch what they do, and ask for advice.
