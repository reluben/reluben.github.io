<h2>PRELIMINARY NOTES</h2>
<p>Right-Handed BackHand (RHBH) is the most common throw for beginners unless you are left-handed. Most discs tend to fade left at the end of a RHBH throw due to physics; if you throw a Right-Handed ForeHand (RHFH) it will fade right at the end. This is mirrored for a left-handed thrower.</p>

<h2>FLIGHT NUMBERS EXPLAINED (Speed / Glide / Turn / Fade)</h2>
    <table><tr><th style="text-align:center">
        SPEED
    </th></tr></table>
<p>How fast the disc must be thrown for the other numbers to apply; correlated with rim width (wider rim → higher speed).</p>

    <table>
        <tr><td>1 to 3</td><td>Putters</td><td>Very stable and accurate due to their slower speed and more controllable flight. Typically easier to make into the basket.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4 to 5</td><td>Midranges</td><td>Relatively straight flight path while still being able to fly farther than a putter.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6 to 9</td><td>Fairway Drivers</td><td>Balanced for accuracy and distance.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10 to 14+</td><td>Distance Drivers</td><td>Cut through headwinds best but need pro-level snap/power (400+ ft arm speed) or they'll dump early/turn too much.</td></tr>
    </table>

        <p><strong>Key Detail:</strong> Speed doesn't directly mean distance — a low-speed, high-glide disc can outfly a high-speed, low-glide disc for most players. Match discs to your arm speed and test with field throws (i.e. beginners should not throw distance drivers).</p>

<table><tr><th style="text-align:center">
    GLIDE
</th></tr></table>
<p>How well the disc stays in the air (loft).</p>

    <table>
        <tr><td>1 to 3</td><td>Drops quickly. Precise for approaches, wind resistance, full-power short shots. Less affected by gusts.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4 to 7</td><td>Floats far, maximizes distance for beginners/average arms. Risky in headwinds (stalls) or for over-powering (overshoots).</td></tr>
    </table>
    
<p><strong>Key Details:</strong> Glide shines at optimal speed - too slow, it fades early; too fast, it turns more. Lightweight discs glide more.</p>

    <table><tr><th style="text-align:center">
    TURN
</th></tr></table>
    <p>Indicates the disc's tendency to move in the direction of its spin during the fastest part of the flight (right after it leaves your hand). For a RHBH this would mean to turn right. This is the disc's High-Speed Stability (HSS).
</p>
    <table>
        <tr><td>+1 to 0</td><td>Overstable/Stable</td><td>Resists turning right, flies straight, or fades left early.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>-1 to -5</td><td>Understable</td><td>Turns right during the high-speed phase of the flight.</td></tr>
    </table>
    
<p><strong>Key Details:</strong> <br>
    Turn activates at/above rated speed; <br>
    Slower throws = less/no turn. If you throw a disc faster than its rated speed, it will exhibit more turn (it will turn over to the right more than the number suggests).<br>
    Wind amplifies: tailwind reduces, headwind increases. <br>
    Use negative turn for shaping shots around obstacles.
</p>

    <table><tr><th style="text-align:center">
    FADE
</th></tr></table>
    <p>Indicates the disc's tendency to move against the direction of its spin during the slowest part of the flight (towards the end of the throw). For a RHBH this would mean to turn left. This is the disc's Low-Speed Stability (LSS).
</p>
    <table>
        <tr><td>0 to 2</td><td>Finish straighter or with a gentle, soft landing. A disc with a Fade of 0 is designed to land as straight as possible.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3 to 5</td><td>Provide a very predictable, strong finish, making them great for headwinds or shots requiring a sharp hook.</td></tr>
    </table>
    
<p><strong>Key Details:</strong> <br>
    Fade starts later/harder with nose-down releases; earlier if underpowered. High fade = reliability for pros.<br>
    High fade discs are usually used for Spike and Skip shots.
</p>

    <table><tr><th style="text-align:left; font-size: 18px;">
    Example: <br>
        Innova Leopard (6 / 5 / -2 / 1) <br>
        Easier for a beginner to throw, reaches far, turns right a bit, gentle finish.
