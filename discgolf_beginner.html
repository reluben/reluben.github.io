    <h1>Disc Golf for Beginners</h1>
    <p>Throw discs into baskets in as few throws as possible. Free courses in parks. Just show up.</p>

    <h2>Rules You Need Day 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Farthest from basket throws next (“away”)</li>
        <li>Play it where it lies</li>
        <li>Disc must finish in basket/chains</li>
        <li>Mark lie with mini or leave disc &amp; stand behind</li>
        <li>Out-of-bounds = +1 stroke &amp; re-throw (or from last in-bounds)</li>
        <li>Don’t hit people</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Start with 3 Discs (150–170g)</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th style="width:25%">Innova Starter Set</th>
            <td style="width:25%">Aviar</td>
            <td style="width:25%">Shark</td>
            <td>Leopard</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>This is a good starter set, all in DX plastic. <br>
        Different plastics that affect how discs fly and feel to you. If you like the Leopard, try it in Star plastic instead of DX. <br>
        Additionally, discs “break-in” and change flight as they get used (and hit trees). Harder plastics resist this more and take longer to change their flight.<br>

    <h2>Fastest Way to Suck Less</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Play 10 rounds (either 9 or 18 holes) with a putter only</li>
        <li>Throw 100 discs in a field (flat &amp; nose-down)</li>
        <li>Putt from 7–10 m every round</li>
        <li>Film yourself</li>
    </ol>
