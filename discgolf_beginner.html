        <h1>Disc Golf for Beginners</h1>
        <p>Throw discs into <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket_(disc_golf)>baskets</a> in as few throws as possible. Free courses in parks. Just show up.</p>

        <h2>Rules You Need Day 1</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Farthest from basket throws next (“away”)</li>
            <li>Play it where it lands</li>
            <li>Disc must finish in basket/chains</li>
            <li>Play behind where disc landed. You can mark it with a mini-disc, another disc, or leave it and throw a disc more suitable for the current throw</li>
            <li>Out-of-bounds = +1 stroke &amp; re-throw (or from last in-bounds)</li>
            <li>Don’t hit people</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Start with 3 Discs (150–170g)</h2>

        </table>
        <p>DX beats-in (gets dinged up and becomes more understable) fast, teaching how disc flights evolve with use (harder plastics resist this more and take longer to change their flight).<br>
            Different plastics affect how discs fly and feel to you. If you like the Leopard, try it in Star plastic instead of DX.<br>

        <h2>Fastest Way to Suck Less</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Play 10 rounds (either 9 or 18 holes) with a putter only</li>
            <li>Throw 100 discs in a field (flat &amp; nose-down)</li>
            <li>Putt from 7–10 m every round</li>
            <li>Film yourself</li>
        </ol>
