    <h1>Disc Golf for Beginners</h1>
    <p>Throw discs into baskets in as few throws as possible. Free courses in parks. Just show up.</p>

    <h2>Rules You Need Day 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Farthest from basket throws next (“away”)</li>
        <li>Play it where it lies</li>
        <li>Disc must finish in basket/chains</li>
        <li>Mark lie with mini or leave disc &amp; stand behind</li>
        <li>Out-of-bounds = +1 stroke &amp; re-throw (or from last in-bounds)</li>
        <li>Don’t hit people</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Start with 3 Discs (150–170g)</h2>

            <td style="text-align:left">Offers excellent control and consistency, making it easier for beginners to practice putting and short-range throws</td>

            <td>Shark</td>
            <td>4/4/0/2</td>

            <td style="text-align:left">Many say that this disc holds a fantastic line, while the throwing style of others creates an extremely sharp fade at the end of flight. This disc is the ideal disc for getting through areas full of small obstacles</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Leopard</td>
            <td>6/5/-2/1</td>
            <td>1.1</td>
            <td style="text-align:left">Stable and predictable flight helps beginners learn how to generate distance without overpowering their throws, making it manageable for new players to control</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>This is a good starter set, all in DX plastic.
        Different plastics that affect how discs fly and feel to you. If you like the Leopard, try it in Star plastic instead of DX. <br>
        Additionally, discs “break-in” and change flight as they get used (and hit trees). Harder plastics resist this more and take longer to change their flight.<br>

    <h2>Fastest Way to Suck Less</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Play 10 rounds (either 9 or 18 holes) with a putter only</li>
        <li>Throw 100 discs in a field (flat &amp; nose-down)</li>
        <li>Putt from 7–10 m every round</li>
        <li>Film yourself</li>
    </ol>
