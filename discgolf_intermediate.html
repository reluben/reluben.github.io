                TO IMPROVE: <br>

                Most players would instantly gain 50–100 feet and a lot of accuracy just by fixing rounding and nose angle.<br>

    <h2>One Disc Challenge</h2>
<p>Typically, no one plays an entire round with a single disc. Many players agree that using a single mold driver is the way to go, a bag with 3+ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/w63ifm/comment/ihbgppk/">Destroyers</a> (this is referred to as a multi-loadout, run, stack, or lineup.  Will elaborate below). However, as mentioned here and in the beginner article, playing a round throwing only a single disc is a great way to improve. This is for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>By keeping one variable the same, namely the disc, you will learn how throwing diffferently affects its flight path</li>
    <li>It forces you to think creatively and plan ahead. Since the disc you will be using has certain flight characteristics you have to figure out the best way to make it to the hole; you can't switch out a disc depending on the situation you're in</li>
    <li>You get to know the disc better. Some discs aren't designed to fly perfectly straight; Some discs are more understable in different plastics, a DX Leopard3 flies differently than a Star Leopard3. By knowing how the disc performs you learn to throw the disc so it flies the way you want</li>
    <li>You get to know the disc better at different levels of wear. As a disc wears hitting trees, the ground, and the basket, its flight characteristics change, its stability changes meaning if it was designed to have -2 turn it might perform now as a -4 turn or maybe a 0 turn. </li>
</ol>
    <table><th>WHY IT WORKS</th></table>
    <p>Not all discs qualify to be part of a stack. The ones that do shine due to high manufacturing variability (domey vs. flat runs), predictable beat-in (gaining turn/glide), diverse plastics/blends, and versatile flights that cover hyzers/anhyzer/S-lines/winds (90-100% of shots) when tuned across 4–10+ copies. Innova, Discraft, Gateway, and Westside all have several discs that come in many plastics. They start out differently from each other and beat-in differently when playing in wooded areas (you hit trees) resulting in a single mold that covers all your needs. Different players prefer the feel of different plastics and molds; stiffness, grippiness, rim depth, etc. all affect what you will prefer and pull out most often.</p>
    <table>
        <th>DESTROYER</th>
    </table>
    <p>The Innova Destroyer (12/5/-1/3) was released in 2007 as the world's first Speed-12 disc. It's renowned as the best-selling overstable distance driver in history, favored by pros for its predictable flight, significant glide, and torque resistance. <br>It flies long and straight with a reliable late fade, excelling in headwinds, maximum distance shots, long hyzers, and sidearm/forehand throws.<br>
    The "multiple Destroyer loadout" (also called a Destroyer "run," "stack," or "lineup") is a popular disc golf strategy where players bag 3–6+ Innova Destroyers tuned to different stability levels, using only them for distance driver shots.
This (mono-mold approach) simplifies the bag, builds deep mastery of one versatile disc, and covers all distance shots (hyzers, anhyzers, S-lines, headwinds/tailwinds) via subtle flight variations. It is the gold standard because its flight covers ~4 molds' worth of stability and it beats in predictably: fresh ones are overstable (OS), while used ones gain turn/glide and become stable or understable (US)—allowing precise shot shaping without switching molds. </p>
    ### Why It Works (Especially for Good Players)
- **Versatility Across Wear Stages**: Destroyers evolve predictably:
  | Wear Stage | Flight (RHBH) | Best For |
  |------------|---------------|----------|
  | New/Beefy (Halo Star/Champion) | Straight w/ hard late fade (minimal turn) | Headwinds, hyzers, forehand bombs, skips |
  | Beat-In Star (field work 5-10 rounds) | Slight turn → glide → S-curve fade | Max distance (450-550+ ft), straight bombers |
  | Flippy DX/Pro (20+ rounds) | Big turn + glide (like a fairway) | Tailwinds, anhyzers, rollers |

- **Approaches & Upturns**: Thumber/flick low-power hyzers (150-250 ft) or rollers for control. Fan grip or reduced power tames speed.
- **Putting**: Spin-putt from <30 ft (aim low left for chains catch). Outside that? Approach close first—your scores will suffer (+5-10 strokes/round), but it's playable & fun.

Real-world proof: Players report personal bests on wooded/open courses with just Destroyers (e.g., 300-400 ft consistent, even in tournaments with minimal bags).

### "Destroyer-Only" Bag Setup (6-10 Discs)
1. **2-3 New OS** (Halo Star/Champion, 173-175g): Wind fighters, hyzers.
2. **3-4 Beat-In** (Star, 170-173g): Distance workhorses.
3. **1-2 Flippy** (DX/Pro, 165-170g): Utility/turnovers.
- **Total Cost**: $60-100 (Infinite Discs used bins for beat-ins).

### Caveats (Expect Tradeoffs)
| Shot Type | Destroyer Rating | Pro Tip |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Long Drives (>350 ft) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Beast mode—your Destroyers shine. |
| Approaches (100-250 ft) | ⭐⭐⭐ | Power down or thumber; less precise than mids. |
| Putting (<50 ft) | ⭐⭐ | Spin it hard; chains grab better than you'd think, but C1X putts = +1s. |
| Technical Woods | ⭐⭐ | Gaps/hyzers ok; tight lines punish speed (use rollers). |

You'll score worse overall (+8-15 strokes vs. full bag) due to less control on 70% of shots (approaches/putts). But for practice, fun challenges, or open courses? Epic. Builds form by forcing adaptation.

**TL;DR**: Do it—bag 6+ in graduated wear. Buy used Star/DX at Infinite Discs ($8-12 ea). Throw a "Destroyer-only" round this weekend & report back. You'll crush drives, grind approaches, & laugh at putts.
