                TO IMPROVE: <br> 
                Fix the big ones first: pull straight, keep the nose down, shift your weight forward, relax your grip, and throw discs you can actually control. <br>
                Most players would instantly gain 50–100 feet and a lot of accuracy just by fixing rounding and nose angle.<br>

    <h2>One Disc Challenge</h2>
<p>As mentioned here and in the beginner article, playing a round throwing only a single disc is a great way to improve. This is for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>By keeping one variable the same, namely the disc, you will learn how throwing diffferently affects its flight path</li>
    <li>It forces you to think creatively and plan ahead. Since the disc you will be using has certain flight characteristics you have to figure out the best way to make it to the hole; you can't switch out a disc depening on the situation you're in</li>
    <li>You get to know the disc better. Some discs aren't designed to fly perfectly straight; Some discs are more understable in different plastics, a DX Leopard3 flies differently thatn a Star Leopard3. By knowing how the disc performs you learn to throw the disc so it flies the way you want</li>
    <li>You get to know the disc better at different levels of wear. As a disc wears hitting trees, the ground, and the basket, its flight characteristics change, its stability changes meaning if it was designed to have -2 turn it might perform now as a -4 turn or maybe a 0 turn. </li>
</ol>
<p>Some pros play with a single mold/model of disc at different levels of wear and preform outstandigly. Meet the Destroyer:</p>
