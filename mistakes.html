                    TO IMPROVE: <br> 
                    Fix the big ones first: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pull straight</li>
                        <li>Keep the nose down</li>
                        <li>Shift your weight forward</li>
                        <li>Relax your grip</li>
                        <li>Throw discs you can actually control</li>
                    </ul>
                    Most players would instantly gain 50–100 feet and a lot of accuracy just by fixing rounding and nose angle.<br>
